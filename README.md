# zkPass -- DID platform based on Mina, Zero Knowledage

zkpass is a crypto identity dapp, it can not only be a smart contract wallet, but also even an identity authenticator. 

You can

**PLEASE navigate to `./demohtml/index.html` to take a look at our MVP design!!**

It protects your real wallet address from exposure (all transactions are by `name`, rather than your wallet address) and allows for a degree of anonymity in transfers. 

Besides, it can be integrated into other DApps as a single sign-on.

And it can also be authorized by your email in the future without fear of losing your private key.
