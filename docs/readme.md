# Shadow -- A Private Account System On Mina

`This doc will present Shadow on a very high level.`

As we talked before, the mixer project is an extracted component from our original design of `zkPass`(Crypto Identity) for this Builder program. Based on this, this mixer project (named `Shadow`) is still based on the account model, which means everyone could register and hold a unique name in the scope. 

To keep this feature and also to keep privacy, we made great effort on the design of how to maintain `Deposition to mixer without name exposure`, `Transfer internally without any exposure`, and `Withdraw from mixer without name exposure`. 
So people could got a unique name in the crypto world and never worry about their asset operations to be traced in the scope.
